# restaurant-page

Live at: https://trustinmagic.github.io/restaurant-page/

Restaurant page created with HTML CSS and JS. Bundled together with webpack.

What I learned

- using webpack to create a bundle (loading css and different assets)
- use modules and import
- create NPM scripts to ease my work with webpack
